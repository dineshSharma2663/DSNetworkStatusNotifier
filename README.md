# DSNetworkStatusNotifier
Most of times in mobile application, we want to be notified whenever our network connection changes &amp; we want to show a network status bar in our app like "No internet connection!" / "You are online" like Facebook. Now I have created a class for the same. It looks better &amp; provides better user experience through out the app.
